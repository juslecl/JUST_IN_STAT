# READING IN ZÜRICH

You **don't know what to do** during the week end, or just looking for a time to **_relax_** and to think of something else than study ? Then let me share this good adress with you. The [PBZ-libraires](https://www.pbz.ch/location/pbz-altstadt/) in Zürich gives you the possibility for a few francs per year to borrow any book for at least a month ! 
It also gives you the opportunity to share activities with people you don't know, or just enjoying a goob book in one of the comfortable lounges !
