# Exercise Week 1 Part B

## R Code

```{r}
sample <- rlnorm(100,5,0.25)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(sample), aes(sample)) + geom_histogram(bins=100)
ggplot(data.frame(log(sample)), aes(log(sample))) + geom_histogram(bins=100)
ggplot(data.frame(sample), aes(sample,sample)) + geom_violin()
```

## Comments about the results

I first generated a random sample of 100 values, according to a log-normal distribution with **mean 5 and variance 0.25**. To build histograms and violin plots, I then **installed the package ggplot2**.

## Data Summary

```{r}
summary(data.frame(sample))
sd(sample)
```

We can then conclude that the mean of our sample is *146.74*, and its standard deviation is of *36.52785*.
